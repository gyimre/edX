    "While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is n0t the best tool for predicting the class in which an observed data point belongs. In order to provide estimate for classification, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class</b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression</b>.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <i>y</i>, to some predictors (independent variables <i>x1</i>, <i>x2</i>, etc.). Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = w0 + w1 \\times x1 + w2 \\times x2 + \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "and finds the values of <i>w0</i>, <i>w1</i>, <i>w2</i>, etc. The term <i>w0</i> is the \"intercept\" or \"constant term\" (it's shown as <i>b</i> in the formula below):\n",

    "Y = W X + b\n",

    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <i>y</i>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the name logistic <i>regression</i>, it is actually a <b>probabilistic classification</b> model. Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{e^y}{1 + e^y} = exp(y) / (1 + exp(y)) = p \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which produces p-values between 0 (as y approaches minus infinity $-\\infty$) and 1 (as y approaches plus infinity $+\\infty$). This now becomes a special kind of non-linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, <i>y</i> is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), <code>exp</code> is the exponential function and $\\theta(y)$ is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\">logistic function</a>, also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve), and was first developed for modeling population growth.\n",
